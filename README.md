## Goal is raise awareness of new ways technology can be used to target people who seem like easy targets.
Hacks in a Scene should be: 
   - [ ] Entertaining
   - [ ] Realistic && Feasibly Possible
   - [ ] Exploiting some weakness

- Exercise in predicting ways people can use technology for no good. 
- Be a break i look forward to while coding! 
- Submit some ideas :bulb: ! 
- Take a break & Write a Scene or submit an idea!
   * Exercise that creative other half of the brain. 
   * Make someone laugh :smile: or teach someone something clever.

#### TODO :clipboard:
<hr>
Simplify formatting a written scene to the standard below.

**"Holly Wood Script"**:
   - [ ] Use a 12pt size of the Courier font
   - [ ] The left margin should be 1.5-inches
   - [ ] The right margin should be 1-inch, ragged
   - [ ] The top and bottom margins should also be 1-inch.
   - [ ] You should have approximately 55 lines on each page, no matter what the size of your paper is. 
   - [ ] Adjust your margins accordingly if you’re using smaller or bigger-sized paper
   - [ ] The names of the dialogue speakers (in CAPS) should be 3.7-inches from the page’s left side.
   - [ ] The parentheticals of the actors should be 3.1-inches from the page’s left side.
   - [ ] The dialogues should be 2.5-inches from the page’s left side.
<hr>

- [ ] Make a blog/form with some scenarios and what led me to this silly idea
